// Q.21 What are the looping structures in JavaScript? Any one Example?

/* Looping Structures in JavaScript:
for loop: Repeats a block of code a specific number of times.
while loop: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
do...while loop: Executes a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as a specified condition is true.
for...in loop: Iterates over the properties of an object.
for...of loop: Iterates over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, etc. */

// example =>
    for(let i=1; i<=10; i++){
        console.log(i)
    }
