Question 1: How are events handled in React compared to vanilla JavaScript? Explain the concept of synthetic events.
Answer:
In Vanilla JavaScript, event handlers are attached using addEventListener(), and the event object is directly provided by the browser.

In React, event handling is done using JSX, where we pass event handlers as props, like:
jsx
Copy
Edit
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
Instead of using "onclick" (lowercase) like in HTML, React uses camelCase (onClick).

What are Synthetic Events?
React wraps the native browser event inside a SyntheticEvent, which is a cross-browser wrapper around the native event. This makes event handling consistent across different browsers.

Example of Synthetic Event:
jsx
Copy
Edit
const handleClick = (event) => {
  console.log(event); // Synthetic Event
  console.log(event.nativeEvent); // Native Browser Event
};
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
Why use Synthetic Events?

React optimizes event handling by using a single event listener for multiple events (Event Delegation).
Ensures compatibility across browsers.
Question 2: What are some common event handlers in React.js? Provide examples of onClick, onChange, and onSubmit.
Answer:
React provides several event handlers. Here are three important ones:

1Ô∏è‚É£ onClick Event Handler
Triggered when a user clicks an element.

jsx
Copy
Edit
const handleClick = () => {
  alert("Button Clicked!");
};

<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
2Ô∏è‚É£ onChange Event Handler
Used with form inputs to capture user input in real-time.

jsx
Copy
Edit
import { useState } from "react";

const InputExample = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setText(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input type="text" value={text} onChange={handleChange} />
      <p>Typed: {text}</p>
    </>
  );
};
3Ô∏è‚É£ onSubmit Event Handler
Used in forms to handle form submission.

jsx
Copy
Edit
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Prevents page refresh
  alert("Form Submitted!");
};

<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Enter name" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
Question 3: Why do you need to bind event handlers in class components?
Answer:
In class components, event handlers do not automatically bind to the component instance (this). If you try to access this.state inside an event handler, this will be undefined.

Example Problem (Without Binding)
jsx
Copy
Edit
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  increment() {
    console.log(this.state.count); // ‚ùå ERROR: 'this' is undefined
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.increment}>Click Me</button>;
  }
}
Solution:
We bind the method in the constructor:

jsx
Copy
Edit
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { count: 0 };
    this.increment = this.increment.bind(this); // ‚úÖ Binding 'this'
  }

  increment() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.increment}>Click Me</button>;
  }
}
Alternatively, you can use an arrow function, which does not lose this context:

jsx
Copy
Edit
increment = () => {
  this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
};
Why is Binding Needed?
JavaScript loses this context in event handlers unless explicitly bound.
Arrow functions automatically bind this, so they are a preferred alternative.

Question 1: What is conditional rendering in React? How can you conditionally render elements in a React component?
Answer:
Conditional rendering in React allows us to show or hide elements dynamically based on certain conditions, like user authentication, form validation, or API responses.

Just like JavaScript, React lets us use if statements, ternary operators, and logical operators (&&) to determine what gets displayed.

Example 1: Using if Statement
jsx
Copy
Edit
const Message = ({ isLoggedIn }) => {
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <h1>Welcome Back!</h1>;
  } else {
    return <h1>Please Log In</h1>;
  }
};
Example 2: Using Ternary Operator (? :)
jsx
Copy
Edit
const Message = ({ isLoggedIn }) => (
  <h1>{isLoggedIn ? "Welcome Back!" : "Please Log In"}</h1>
);
Example 3: Using Logical AND (&&)
jsx
Copy
Edit
const Message = ({ isLoggedIn }) => (
  <>
    <h1>Welcome to the site</h1>
    {isLoggedIn && <h2>Glad to see you again!</h2>}
  </>
);
Here, if isLoggedIn is false, <h2> will not be rendered.

Question 2: Explain how if-else, ternary operators, and && (logical AND) are used in JSX for conditional rendering.
Answer:
React does not allow if-else statements directly inside JSX. Instead, we use JavaScript expressions like ternary operators and && inside JSX.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Using if-else (Outside JSX)
We write logic before returning JSX because if-else cannot be used inside JSX.

jsx
Copy
Edit
const UserGreeting = ({ isLoggedIn }) => {
  let message;
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    message = <h1>Welcome Back!</h1>;
  } else {
    message = <h1>Please Log In</h1>;
  }
  return <div>{message}</div>;
};
2Ô∏è‚É£ Using Ternary Operator (? :)
‚úÖ Best for inline conditions when rendering one of two elements.

jsx
Copy
Edit
const UserGreeting = ({ isLoggedIn }) => (
  <h1>{isLoggedIn ? "Welcome Back!" : "Please Log In"}</h1>
);
3Ô∏è‚É£ Using && (Logical AND)
‚úÖ Best for conditionally rendering an element when a condition is true.

jsx
Copy
Edit
const ShowAdminMessage = ({ isAdmin }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Dashboard</h1>
    {isAdmin && <p>You have admin access</p>}
  </div>
);
üîπ If isAdmin is false, <p>You have admin access</p> won‚Äôt render at all.

Rendering Lists in React - Interview Perspective
Question 1: How do you render a list of items in React? Why is it important to use keys when rendering lists?
Answer:
In React, we use the .map() method to iterate over an array and return JSX elements dynamically.

Example: Rendering a List
jsx
Copy
Edit
const FruitsList = () => {
  const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];

  return (
    <ul>
      {fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{fruit}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
Why are Keys Important?
Keys help React efficiently update the UI when a list changes by uniquely identifying each element. Without keys, React may re-render elements incorrectly, leading to performance issues and UI bugs.

Question 2: What are keys in React, and what happens if you do not provide a unique key?
Answer:
üîπ Keys are unique identifiers given to list elements to help React track and update elements efficiently when the list changes.

What Happens If You Don‚Äôt Provide a Key?
React shows a warning in the console:
"Each child in a list should have a unique ‚Äòkey‚Äô prop."
React may re-use incorrect elements, causing UI inconsistencies.
Performance issues increase as React compares elements inefficiently.
Correct Way: Using Unique IDs as Keys
‚úÖ Best Practice: Use a unique id from the data instead of index.

jsx
Copy
Edit
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Rahul" },
  { id: 2, name: "Amit" },
  { id: 3, name: "Priya" },
];

const UsersList = () => (
  <ul>
    {users.map((user) => (
      <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);
Here, id is unique and prevents issues when adding, removing, or reordering elemnts.

====================================================

Handling Forms in React
Question 1: How do you handle forms in React? Explain the concept of controlled components.
Answer:
In React, forms are handled using controlled components, meaning React controls the form inputs by storing their values in the component‚Äôs state.

Example of a Controlled Component:
jsx
Copy
Edit
import { useState } from "react";

const FormExample = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setName(e.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert(`Submitted Name: ${name}`);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default FormExample;
How it Works?
The value of the input is controlled by state (name).
onChange updates state when the user types.
React fully controls the input's value.
üîπ Benefits of Controlled Components:
‚úî Easier to manipulate data
‚úî Works well with validation
‚úî Provides better control over form behavior

Question 2: What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?
Feature	Controlled Component	Uncontrolled Component
State Management	Stores form values in React state	Stores form values in the DOM (default behavior)
Accessing Value	useState & onChange	Uses ref to access DOM value
Best for	Forms with validation, real-time updates	Simple forms without frequent updates
Example	<input value={state} onChange={handleChange} />	<input ref={inputRef} />
Example of an Uncontrolled Component (Using ref)
jsx
Copy
Edit
import { useRef } from "react";

const UncontrolledForm = () => {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert(`Submitted Name: ${inputRef.current.value}`);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default UncontrolledForm;
üìå Key Differences:

In controlled components, React manages the input‚Äôs value via useState().
In uncontrolled components, the input keeps its value in the DOM, and we use useRef() to access it.
